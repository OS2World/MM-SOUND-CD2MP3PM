Welcome to CD2MP3 1.14a!  The next step into MP3 world ... after PM123.
=======================

I always make my products very straightforward and fast to use, and I hope
this one lives up to my expectations.  Tell me what you think.

The BEST way to thank me if you like this program is to register your copy
of PM123. ;)  Thank you.  Did you know I do this instead of working for
paying my university expenses?  Oh, you don't know what is PM123?  point
your Web Browser to http://sektori.com/pm123/ and
http://www.cam.org/~guardia/pm123.html ASAP, you don't know what you're
missing!

Thanks to Aglaja Przyborski <aglaja@ibm.net> and Klaus Staedtler for the
nice icons.


Usage
=====

For the MP3 setup, choose your Encoder and the global bitrate (ie.: not per
channel).  Not all the bitrates are supported for all WAV files and by all
Encoders.  Low Priority will launch the encoder in idle priority.  (This
doesn't work for DOS programs, and for some programs like BladeEnc, see
Notes).  High Quality is implementation depended (see below).  Specify the
MP3 directory where the final MP3 is to be placed, and write some last
minute custom parameters to be placed on the Encoder's command line.

For CDDB support, it is *****VERY IMPORTANT**** that you setup an e-mail
address before attempting to do anything.  Afterwards, you can add new
servers and the one you select will be the one used during operations,
unless "Try all servers" is active.  "Filename format" is used when CDDB
information was found and "Fallback filename format" is used when no
information was found.  HTTP support is only useful when you need to access
the web through a proxy or behind a firewall.

The filename formats have the following format specifications:

%t = song title
%a = album artist
%l = album title
%y = year
%c = song comment
%g = genre

%k = song track
%C = album comment

%m = length (minutes)
%s = length (remaining seconds)
%S = length (ALL in seconds).

To Grab CD Tracks, set the Grabber.  If CD2MP3 didn't detect your CD drive
correctly, type it in.  Set an appropriate (ie.: huge) Temporary directory
that will hold the WAV files.  After refreshing the view, you can start
selecting tracks.  There is a popup menu available, and the usual container
accelerators are available (shift-f8, shift-f9, shift-f10, ctrl-/, ctrl-\,
shift-arrows, alt-mb1, etc.). Custom is to add last minute custom parameters
to the Grabber's command line.

To convert WAV files, add WAV files by either bringing up the file dialog
or by dragging and dropping WAV files in the listbox.  The correspondent
key for Add is Insert and Delete for Delete.

NOTE!!  If something goes terribly wrong with CDDB and you can't figure it
out, CD2MP3 PM writes to the invisible console what comes in and out of the
sockets.  So start CD2MP3 PM with console redirection to see what happens.
ie.: "cd2mp3pm > log"


Super Grab
==========

While in Super Grab mode, CD2MP3 PM gives the Encoder a priority a bit
higher than the Grabber.  For example, if you set Low Priority, the Encoder
is running at idle class, delta 1, and the Grabber at idle class, delta 0.
Without Low Priority, the Encoder is running normal class, delta 1 and the
Grabber, normal class, delta 0.

This is good when you're not trying to run a DOS program, as you know the
OS/2 APIs can't set the priority for a DOS session.  So if you intend to
use a DOS Encoder at Low Priority, edit the cd2mp3pm.cfg and follow the
steps below to set the priority at "i1".  If not, set it to "r1".  The same
for a DOS Grabber, "i0" and "r0".

Also note that real concurrent Encoding and Grabbing will only occur if you
have a Bus Mastered CD-ROM drive connected and setup on a Bus Mastered
controller.  For example, the secondary ATA controller on my motherboard is
defective and doesn't work with Bus Mastering, and I have my CD-ROM drive
plugged in it.


Notes
=====

CD2MP3 doesn't always know when a session has been killed or has stopped
normally, so to prevent CD2MP3 from continuing as nothing happened, press
Stop instead.  If the session doesn't get killed, then try to kill it by
yourself.  This is the case for Win32-OS/2 programs.  Don't try to close
the window.  You will not accomplish anything by doing so.  Kill -9 doesn't
work on them either.  There are no way to terminate such sessions at the
moment, but fortunately, ToMPG will end on a couple of key stroke.

To run DOS programs at idle priority, you will have to use Set Priority.
(http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/system/sp103.zip)  After installing
the utility properly, edit the Config file, set the executable to
spdos.exe, and EncoderBefore parameter to something like "i1 l3enc.exe".

Alfons DOES NOT accept a temporary directory.  It will use the current
directory as a WAV place holder.  THIS IS NOT A BUG IN CD2MP3.  It's even a
feature, else Alfons wouldn't work at all.

Also note that BladeEnc sets its own priority, so CD2MP3 PM has _no_
control over it.  Use its command line options to see which one makes it
operate like it should.


Known Bugs
==========

- Deleting the last record while in shift-f8 mode traps in PMCTLS.DLL.
  This is an OS/2 bug.  Hell, it even happens in the WPS, but it can
  recover due to great recovery mechanism.

- GrabberAcceptsOutput = FALSE screws the wav->mp3 function.  Erase the
  temporary directory entry field when using such a Grabber.

- Same thing for Encoders and ID3 Tag function...

- HTTP/Proxy Authentification doesn't work.  Anybody need this?

- Proxy support untested.  Please test it.  If the code works at all, it
  only works on HTTP/1.1 proxies.  HTTP/1.0 proxies are not very useful in
  any case. .. ??


Config Files
============

The config file cd2mp3pm.cfg permits to add custom CD Grabber and MP3
Encoder programs support into CD2MP3.   Read the comments in the file for
more information.


Grabbers/Encoders Notes
=======================

I included Leech, Alfons and JCread2, because I don't know of any other, do
you?

Although, today I find LAME is the best encoder, I do not have time to
update others.txt.

I included ToMPG, L3Enc and BladeEnc because I these were the best
encoders when I had time to play with others.txt.  ToMPG is more than 9
times faster than L3Enc, and I can hear little difference when encoding
CD quality WAVs at 128kb/s. Use it when you're in a hurry.  L3Enc 2.x
just gives the best quality at 128kb/s. It's downsampling is magnificent
and it even supports MPEG 2.5. With new "LFN support" for DOS encoders,
you can now finally use L3Enc 2.x for DOS in all the comfort of long
filenames as CD2MP3 PM will do the dirty renaming work. And finally, the
author of BladeEnc assures his encoder gives best quality at and over
160kb/s (seems to be the case).

If you want to know more about my encoder choices, or where to find them,
read others.txt.


History
=======

1.14 - May 3, 2001
----

- Added default configuration for GOGO and LAME encoders.
- Changed default cddb server to freecddb.org.  cddb.com does not work anymore.
- EncoderBefore didn't work
- Problems with multiple match crashing CD2MP3 PM now solved.

1.13 - October 4, 1999
----

- CDDB server requires 8 char long ID.  Some CDs ID are now correctly
  prefixed with zeros.
- Multiple exact match now works.

1.12 - January 30, 1999
----
- Modified readcd to be CTCDROM.DMD compatible (This CD drive manager of
  Unite CD Maker doesn't want to read in the CODE segment, so I had to
  define local variables for the parameter)
- Was able to properly make the notebook context menu, thanks to
  Eric Norman <warped@cs.montana.edu>

1.11
----
- Fixed problems on CD drive opening failure.
- Made various entry fields bigger.
- Now does automatic translation of invalid filename characters.
- Fixed keyboard mnemonic in the main dialog.
- Added a few mini-icons.  It seems the PM doesn't draw mnemonic underlines
  anymore, but they are still there (R for Refresh, C for Convert, S for
  Stop and A for Cancel)
- Fixed some socket failure report problem.
- Added more ID3 Tag Genres.

1.10
----

- Added CDDB support as well as ID3 tag support!
- Added the ability to edit container fields.
- Added mnemonics to static text... thanks to
  Stefan Ruck <100664.1353@compuserve.com> for the trick in EDM/2!
- Kludged Win32-OS/2 return code better.  It should now never care about
  what garbage it may return.
- Updated CFG file for new encoders and grabbers.
- Fixed crash when auto-removing records from the WAV container.
- Added "LFN support" for DOS programs through smart renaming.

- Sorry Aglaja Przyborski, didn't have the time to add the new icons.

1.01
----

- DOH!!  pointers did it again... basename wasn't functional
- remove & deselect wasn't save and reloaded to its previous state

1.0
---

- Lots of things

0.91
----

- numbering will go like 01,02,03 ... instead of 1,2,3.  Someone pointed
  out only the former sorts properly after 9.
- new GrabberNoDrive option for program such as READCDA
- new EncoderAcceptsOutput for program such as BladeEnc

0.90
----

- Initial release
